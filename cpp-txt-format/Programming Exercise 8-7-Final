////////////////////////Programming Exercise 8-7///////////////////////////////
/*
				Write a program that allows the user to enter the last names
				of five candidates in a local election and the number of votes
				received by each candidate. The program should then output each
				candidateâ€™s name, the number of votes received, and the
				percentage of the total votes received by the candidate.

				Your program should also output the winner of the election.
*/
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

				The following is the Checks that were implemented to get a 100%

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
	Check #1:
				Code Pattern - Complete
				Check for output cout headers in code

				Description
				Searched your code for a specific pattern:

				-	cout << "Candidate\s+Votes Received\s+% of Total Votes"

	Check #2:
				Code Pattern - Complete
				Check for winner cout in code

				Description
				Searched your code for a specific pattern:

				-	cout << "The Winner of the Election is "

	Check #3:
				Successful Output -- this was the easy part.
