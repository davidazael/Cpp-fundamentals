Write a program that allows the user to enter the last names 
of five candidates in a local election and the number of votes
received by each candidate. The program should then output each
candidateâ€™s name, the number of votes received, and the 
percentage of the total votes received by the candidate. 

Your program should also output the winner of the election.
